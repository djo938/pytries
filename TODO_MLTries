TODO
    -what about the alias ?
        managed outside of the mltries

DATA TEST
    charset = [a,b,c,d]
    a string is made with three char (64 pos)
    a string path is made with 1, 2 or 3 string  (262144 pos)

PROPERTIES
    -hypothesis : the tries properties are valid
    -each string list corresponds to an existing value in the tree
    -each value node correspond to an existing string list
    -no redundant path
        each mltries store only one occurence of a string
    -no cycle
        use a coloring algorithm to test that

TEST
    -test the properties
    -test error case
        like what ?
            -insert a string twice
            -look after exception triggering
    -test removal 
    -test update
        -on several level
    -test the two traversal
